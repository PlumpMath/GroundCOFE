Requirements for Running GroundCOFE on Eclipse:
	Download eclipse indigo(currently the latest version) from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
	Download java jdk x86 version 1.7 from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-7u3-download-1501626.html
	-Note must be the x86 version, because this program uses 32 bit libraries, must be 1.7 because this program uses 1.7 switch features

Getting the Code for contribution
	download from git
		1) open up eclipse
		2)click help->install new software
		3)on the drop down box click all available sites

	2)select Main.java
	3)Hit the f-11 key on your keyboard
	test
	
Reed  5/8
two ERRORS right now
Weird "?" error
velocity / position are sometimes flipped.  this error can be reproduced by indexing az, and then indexing el

Todo:	
maximum velocity and acceleration display and control.  something similar to min/max az/el
joystick should be a pure move relative, without going through Stage.moveAbsolute
ra/dec calibration
redo popup window text entry

status area.  the user needs information about what's going on in the program


debug needs to show absolute position

raster scan

data output.  during ra/dec tracking and scanning.  into some sort of text file


ra/dec + raster scan
fool proof.  try breaking the program
seperate GUI for FTDI and GALIL
refactor moving



ActGalil

encoderRelative  PR
encoderAbsolute  PA

moveAbsolute (pos in degrees)
  calls encoderAbsolute
moveRelative (pos in encoder or degrees)
  calls encoderRelative

validateMove






Stage

move(MC)
  MainWindow calls this
stage will examine the MC to determine what to do
if (relative)
  axis.MoveRelative(MC)





MoveCommand
type (degrees or encoder)
relative or absolute
azValue & elValue



customize user interface for galil or ftdi?
slightly implemented 4/17 Reed.  made "encoder steps" radio button hidden if stageType is galil


Jason 4/11
	Renabled limits in stage-added printstatements to AllowedMove in ActGalil
	Added a dialog box that pops up when user tries to move outside limits inside main window, had to import JOptionpane


Jason 4/13
	Changed ui interface of gotopos
	removed superfulous code in AzElWindow 
Why is the 10 important in the velocity code
